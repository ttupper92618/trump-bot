# **Trump Bot**

## **What is this thing?**

Trump Bot is a react app consuming the leap AI API, and deploying a custom model designed to produce images of a certain former president who is variously loved or loathed. 

## **How do I use it?**

Provide your prompt, and the model will generate an image matching your criteria.

## **Why?**

The technology of AI image generation is extraordinarily interesting, and this is a fun way to explore what is possible and also to shine a light on the potential ramifications of thie technology.

## **Responsible use**

Trump Bot is not intended to offend, mock, or disparage. It *can* be used in this manneer, but the bot itself is neutral; you can use it to generate images of any variety you choose. The bot is not political, and whatever bias you might find is introduced by the user, e.g. <u>**you**</u>, not the app. **This means you should accept responsibility for how you use it,** ***and you should use it responsibly.***
